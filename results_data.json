Check out how good everything came up! The interior smell is indescribably good, and the wax coat on the red paint is just brilliant.",

It also received a full interior and exterior detail, as well as a wheel & tyre detail to compliment the paint work. The grime and tar from the road proved a formidable foe, but I always come out on top. Same goes for the deluge of pet hair and sand on the inside. That combined with this car itself being a smash hit, I have no doubt that this car will turn the heads of prospective buyers.",

Like clockwork, the exterior detailing process lifted out virtually all light to moderate scratches in the paint while bringing out the shine I knew it had. The interior received the same degree of treatment, eliminating stains, pet hair and other debris. This one is sure to catch eyes and sell quickly!",
